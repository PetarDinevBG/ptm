    "A further aim of this exercise is to learn about statistical characteristics of text data. At the moment, our texts are represented as long character strings wrapped in document objects of a corpus. To analyze which word forms the texts contain, they must be __tokenized__. This means that all the words in the texts need to be identified and separated. Only in this way is it possible to count the frequency of individual word forms. A word form is also called **\"type\"**. The occurrence of a type in a text is a **\"token\"**.\n",

    "For text mining, text are further transformed into a numeric representation. The basic idea is that the texts can be represented as statistics about the contained words (or other content fragments such as sequences of two words). The list of every distinct word form in the entire corpsu forms the **vocabulary** of a corpus. For each document, we can count how often each word of the vocabulary occurs in it. By this, we get a term frequency vector for each document. The dimensionality of this term vector corresponds to the size of the vocabulary. Hence, the word vectors have the same form for each document in a corpus. Consequently, multiple term vectors representing different documents can be combined into a matrix. This data structure is called **document-term matrix** (DTM).\n",
